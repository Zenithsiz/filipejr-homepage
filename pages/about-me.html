<div class="about-me">
	<h1>Bio</h1>
	<hr />
	<p>My name is Filipe Rodrigues. Online I typically use the handle <i>zenithsiz</i>.</p>
	<p>I've been programming since I was a child.</p>
	<p>My first encounter with programming was with Lua inside of ComputerCraft, a mod for Minecraft.</p>

	<p>From there, I self-taught myself Python, C, C++ and Rust.</p>

	<p>
		I became very proficient in C++, learning the many quirks of the language and kept up with it until around C++20.
	</p>
	<p>I switched over to Rust at the start of the 2018 edition, and nowadays I don't make any new projects in C++.</p>

	<p>
		Nowadays, I mostly program in Rust (in fact,
		<a :href="THIS_WEBSITE">this website</a> runs on rust using wasm).
	</p>

	<h1>Degree</h1>
	<hr />
	<p>
		I currently have a bachelor's degree at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (IST) in Telecommunications and Informatics
		Engineering.
	</p>
	<p>I am currently doing a master's in the same degree.</p>
